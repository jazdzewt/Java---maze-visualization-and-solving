# Java Maze App

## Project description

This project aims to develop a software application capable of reading maze maps stored in either plain text (.txt) or binary (.bin) formats, rendering them graphically, facilitating user-defined adjustments to the starting and exit points within the maze, and employing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to ascertain the shortest path from the designated starting point to the exit. The application addresses key functionalities such as file parsing, graphical representation, user interaction, algorithmic computation, and visual feedback.
